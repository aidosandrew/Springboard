    "# Using Featuretools to Predict Missed Appointments\n",
    "In this notebook, we use [Featuretools](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools) to automatically generate features relating to when patients don't show up for doctor appointments. We quickly reconstruct the features that were made by hand in the most popular [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/somrikbanerjee/predicting-show-up-no-show) and make some other interesting features automatically."
